=> As the layers increase the Accuracy Increases But as a layer the accuracy doesnot make much difference. By adding a layer 
    their we stop increasing layers

=> Aim is to find the weight where their is minimum loss. Learning rate of model should be according to weight at minimum loss

=> Gradient Descent is the optimization algorithm for finding the weight that gives minimum loss and it process continuously untill 
    the weight obtained
