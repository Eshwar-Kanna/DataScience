Correlation :

correlation refers to the statistical relationship between two variables. It measures the degree to which changes in one variable are associated with changes in another variable.

The correlation coefficient, often denoted as r,

In machine learning, understanding the correlation between variables is essential for feature selection, model interpretation, and identifying relationships within the data. High correlations between independent variables (multicollinearity) can lead to issues such as instability in the model coefficients or difficulty in interpreting the model.

Array :

arrays are versatile data structures in machine learning, used to represent and manipulate data in various dimensions and shapes, facilitating the implementation of machine learning algorithms and the analysis of complex datasets.

Slicing :

Slicing in machine learning refers to the process of extracting a subset of data from a larger dataset or array. It allows you to select specific portions of the data based on indices or ranges along one or more dimensions. Slicing is a fundamental operation used for data manipulation, preprocessing, and feature extraction in machine learning workflows.
