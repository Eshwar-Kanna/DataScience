Converting a MODEL to APP

As soon as we close the code the variables get undefined 

joblib is a Python library primarily used for efficiently saving and loading Python objects 
It is particularly useful in machine learning workflows for persisting trained models, preprocessing pipelines, and intermediate data representations

Instead writing the complete code for MODEL each time we use. We can save model to a file and load the file when required

extension must be .pk1

import joblib

joblib.dump(model, 'model-1.pk1')   --- to save the model as model-1.pk1

model = joblib.load('model-1.pk1')

the weight effect of each independent value can be either positive or negative

for an example 

no.of hours studied will impact positively in scoring marks
no.of hours played will impact negatively in scoring marks
