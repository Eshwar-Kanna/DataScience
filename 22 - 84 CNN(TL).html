Transfer Learning:
Tuning:

Net (design 
Build Model (weights)

=> The precreated models has the fixed weight that they created with the model
=> If we had a requirement adding custom class of dataset for which we dont have weights in it. such cases we can use the precreated and we we train with our new class images
    or new category images

=> here we are transfering the learnings of a precreated model to an other model
=> we remove only the last layer and add the layers according to the requirement

For TRansfeRRING THE LEARNING WE Should set all the upper layers trainable = False 

model.layers[0].trainable = False

for i in model.layers :
    i.trainable = False


=> output layers are also called as top layers 

include_top = False # for removing the output layer and we see it in summary

We make all old layers trainable to False and add new layers
