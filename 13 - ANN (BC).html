  dataset = pd.read_csv("Pima_diabatics.csv" , header = None)
          => we use header=None when their are no headings for the dataset and then the 1st will also be treated as row

=> the models removes the features that are not much effecting on the weight
=> Neurons that are not having effective weight are removed and effective neurons are considered
=> As the no. of layers increases the time increases
=> Activation function is used at the final neuron according to the type of operation needed such as regression and classification 
=> When we consider more than one layer then the activation function of all layer till last are " relu " and the input shape is
    not needed fromm second
=> code remains same till dense layers as previous model

  model.compile ( optimizer = "adam" , loss = "binary_crossentropy")
  model.fit( x , y )
  activation  = "sigmoid"  for classification
