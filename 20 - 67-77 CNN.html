Tuning : process of optimizing hyperparameters of a model to improve its performance on a given dataset.

=> The image data will be converted to text, with each piece of text being assigned a unique number.
=> Every pixel in the image is treated as an individual record or column.
=> Yann LeCun is often referred to as the father of deep learning.
=> When using input_dim instead of input_shape, you should provide the shape as [None, ...]. For example: model.predict(x_test_1d[2:3][None, ...]).
=> It is necessary to convert multi-dimensional data into one-dimensional form before feeding it into a Dense layer. A pre-built function called Flatten is used for this purpose.

=> In an image, each pixel is treated as an individual feature. For example, an image with 25 pixels corresponds to 25 features, represented as x1, x2, x3, x4 ...x25 , which equals 25 columns.

=> Larger images with more pixels result in a higher number of features, leading to larger weight matrices that require more computation and time. To reduce the number of features, we can combine neighboring pixels into a single pixel, a process that should be done carefully to minimize loss of information.

=> Pooling is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of an image by down-sampling it, which involves combining the values of neighboring pixels. The size of the pooling window (pool size) is crucial and should be chosen appropriately.

=> Pooling is the process used to convert larger images into smaller, more manageable pixel representations.

=> Feature learning refers to the process of identifying the most important features necessary for recognizing an entity in an image and selecting those features.

=> Convolution is used to select and emphasize the important features from an image, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant aspects for classification or recognition.

=> edge detection : a technique in image processing used to identify and locate sharp changes in intensity, which correspond to boundaries or edges of objects within an image.

=> The convolutional layer extracts important features from an image by applying filters that detect patterns 
  such as edges, textures, and shapes, which are essential for tasks like image recognition and classification.

=> Activation layers : apply activation functions to the outputs of neurons from the preceding layer. 
  These functions introduce non-linearity into the network, which is essential for learning complex patterns and making accurate predictions.
