  softmax is the math function used for multi-classification 

  Dataset = Wines.csv

  aggregating  -> counting each category  -> y.value_counts()
  pd.get_dummies(y)  --> since model cannot create pattern for it here we dont neglect one column as trapping because 
          these are the values of y . We neglect for x 

  import seaborn as sns
  sns.scatterplot ( x = '' , y = 'y' , data = dataset )
        here we get the graph of y categories

  => In multi classification the no.of neurons in last layer is equal to no.of categories of y

  => kernel_initializers  = "he_normal"

  => Bydefault keras use Glorot and Xavier initializers

  => for Multi classification loss = " categorical_crossentropy " , metrics = ["accuracy"] , activation = "softmax"

  model.fit ( x , y  , epochs = 100 )

  => no. of epochs is giving or training the same dataset for mentioned no.of times hence the loss decreases. 
we decrease the no. of epochs where loss not reduced.

  => model.history.history    ----> loss of each epoch

  => myloss  = model.history.history["loss"]

          pd.DataFrame(myloss) = myloss

          myloss.plot()
