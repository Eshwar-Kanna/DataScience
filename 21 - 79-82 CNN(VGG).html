      We use a library called PIL for image processing from a source library pillow in similar to CV2 from openCV.
      We have the image feature in the keras but even keras uses PIL behind
      ILSVRC conducted a challenger to create model with a dataset of 10,000 classes and effecient prediction. VGG won the challenge with more than 90% of accuracy.
      VGG 16 indicates 16 layers in the model and VGG 19 as 19 layers


      Amazon Sagemaker:

      The predicting image should be of same size and shape in similar to the images we trained to the model. for which we use a parameter target_size(). 

      We can get the image size from the layer 1. If the shape is (None , 224 , 224 , 3) which represents 4D then the target_size(224  , 224 ) will be used for the predicting image.

      We have a precreated functions in PIL for converting the image to desired shape. preprocessing_input and decode_predictions to retrive the name from the predicted values.
