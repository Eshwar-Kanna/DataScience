Firstly makesure what kind of data given and what value to predict 

Linear Regression :

It is a supervised learning algorithm commonly employed for predictive modeling and inference tasks.

The primary goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting linear relationship between the independent variables 
X and the dependent variable Y. This relationship is represented by a linear equation of the form:

Y= β0+β1.X1+β2.X2+…+βn.Xn+ϵ

Y is the dependent variable (target) being predicted.
X1 , X2 ... Xn  are the independent variables (features).
β0 , β1 , β2 ... βn are the coefficients (parameters) of the linear equation.
ϵ represents the random error term, capturing the discrepancy between the predicted and actual values.

matplotlib : It provides a flexible and comprehensive set of functions for creating various types of plots, charts, and graphs to explore and visualize data effectively. 

scatter : scatter() function is used to create scatter plots, which are graphical representations of data points in a two-dimensional space

plot : In Matplotlib, a "plot" generally refers to a graphical representation of data. It could be a line plot, scatter plot, bar plot, histogram, pie chart.

If the data is simple and changing Linearly then it is said to be Simple Linear Regression 

Having Multiple Independent values Leads to Multi Linear Regression 



Predicting the salary of new Joining based on Experience 

in such cases w act as model.coef-  and  y = w * x doesnt provide accurate value   since here the model creates a bias value according to the pattern
y = b + w*x

Models Becomes considerable only if the accuracy is > 80 %

We calculate the accuracy by predicting the existing dependent value and compare the outcome
