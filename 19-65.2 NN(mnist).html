The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is a widely used benchmark in the field of machine learning and computer vision

The dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each of size 28x28 pixels. This includes 60,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing.

Machine learning models, especially neural networks, often perform better when input data is normalized. 
Normalization typically involves scaling the data to a range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1). 
For example, pixel values in the MNIST dataset, which range from 0 to 255, can be scaled to a range of 0 to 1 by dividing by 255. 
This requires the values to be in floating-point format.

 to_categorical is used to convert class vectors (integers) to binary class matrices / class labels to one-hot encoded vectors.
