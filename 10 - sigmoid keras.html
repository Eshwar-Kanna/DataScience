Sigmoid Function works as    >=0.5 = 1    <=0.5 = 0

			sigmoid  = 1/(1+e power  -Z)
			
			Machine Learning  ----  Traditional , Deep Learning ( AI , NN , Algo )
			
			
Feature Selection of Dataset Having Millions of columns is harder manually for Quicker we use Neural Networks  

Neurons of Brain are the Reason to recognize the Objects by creating some pattern and storing in memory 

NN works according to the method by which we get Accurate Weight
