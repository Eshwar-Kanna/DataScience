Classification :  classification is a type of supervised learning task where the goal is to predict the categorical class label of new instances based on past observations with known class labels. The output variable in classification is discrete and represents different categories or classes.

  
 Binary Classification : Binary classification is a type of supervised learning task in machine learning where the goal is to classify instances into one of two classes or categories. The output variable in binary classification is discrete and can take on only two possible values, often denoted as positive (1) and negative (0).

Kaggle  --- for downloading Datasets 

dataset.head(10)    ---- for first 10 rows in Dataset

dataset.tail(10) ----- for last 10 rows in Dataset


Dataset --> Feature Selection ---> Data Preprocess  ---> Model  ---> Accuracy  --> prediction 

	
	Feature Selection   1. manual
						2. Automatic    ------ Lasso  , NN
						3. EDA
						
	
	import  seaborn as sns
	
	sns.countplot(feature)      ------    Gives bargraph individually 
	
	sns.countplot(dataset['Feature'] , hue='kind' , data=dataset )
	
	we can get graphical representation each kind of data of that feature  in Dataset
	
	
	For Filling Missing Data
	
		import Pandas   
		
		dataset.isnull()
		
		sns.heatmap(dataset.isnull())
		
		
If there are morethan 1 feature having null data  remove other columns except one and use one after another

take the average of each kind of each feature and fill the average value at the place of null
