Test and Train


70% of dataset will be trained and 30% of Dataset will be tested for an ideal model

we import train-test-split from sklearn to divide the training and testing data from the dataset 

Scikit-learn, often abbreviated as sklearn, is a popular machine learning library in Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data analysis and modeling. 
		It is built on top of other scientific computing libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib and is designed to work seamlessly with these libraries.
		
		
Accuracy  =  ( Prediction / Actual ) * 100


initializers for bias and weight will be  0 , 0  and varies untill loss becomes Zero or Minimum

initializers are functions or strategies used to initialize the parameters of a model before training. 
	These parameters typically include weights and biases in neural network layers or coefficients in linear models		
	
	
	Mean Absolute Error ( MAE ) = [( y1 - y^1 ) + ( y2 - y^2) + ( y3 - y^3 ) + .....+ (yn - y^n )] / n
	
	
	y_pred  = model( x_test )
	
	metrics are quantitative measures used to evaluate the performance of a model on a dataset. 
		These metrics provide insights into how well the model is performing in terms of various aspects such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and others, depending on the type of task (e.g., classification, regression, clustering).
		
		import metrics from sklearn 
		metrics.mean_absolute_error ( y_test , y_pred )
