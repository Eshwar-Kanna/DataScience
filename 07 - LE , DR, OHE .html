Kernel   --- software   +   hardware

PID

Feature Selection : 

In a Model every input should be of integer 

Label Encoding  = string to integer conversion 

Data Reprocessing 

from sklearn-preprocessing import LabelEncoder

Z = LabelEncoder ()

key = z.fit_transform( Feature_name )

OneHotEncoder   it is to create Dummy variables
feature_ohe = OneHotEncoder()

feature_ohe.fit_transform(key)


convert variable to 2D  using  .toaray()

Dummy varaiables trap   --- neglecting Columns

Multicollinearity  --- highely related independent varaiables

variable Trap --- When we create a dummy variable using OHE. in default it creates 3 set of dummy variables in all 3 only two will impact so we neglect the third set

numpy.hstack   :  it is used to horizontally stack arrays or matrices along their columns. The "hstack" stands for "horizontal stack."

numpy.vstack  :   it is used to vertically stack arrays or matrices along their rows. The "vstack" stands for "vertical stack."
